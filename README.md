Pylox is a Lox interpreter, implemented in Python, based on the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)
by Bob Nystrom.

> I am currently working through Chapter 9.

> Also, I have implemented some of the chapter challenges so far, but not all. Eventually I want to 100% the Tree-Walk Interpreter section

## Installation

Pull from Github

> Requires Python 3.10 or later

I use [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/) to manage the Python environment

## Challenges

Ch 4. Scanning

- [X] Support for C-style block comments (NOT nestable)

Ch 5. Representing Code

- [X] AST print Reverse Polish Notation

Ch 6. Parsing Expressions

- [ ] Comma Operator
- [ ] Ternary Operator
- [X] Error productions for binary operators without left-hand side expression

Ch 7. Evaluating Expressions

- [] ~~define "+" so that if one operand is string, it coerces other operand to string~~ I don't really like this behaviour with strings. Between floats and ints this is okay, but Lox anyways only has float type
- [X] handle zero division error

Ch 8. Statements and State

- [X] Evaulate expressions in REPL
- [X] Runtime error when accessing uninitialized variables
